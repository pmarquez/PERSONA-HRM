# PERSONA-HRM
 Human Resources Management for the 21st Century

PERSONA has been conceived as an HRM platform that emphasizes the HUMAN part of the HRM.

Now, since github is for code, I will briefly describe a few of the design goals and technical elements that will be a part of the platform.

SOME DESIRED GOALS 100% decoupling between server and clients. 100% componentized [web client, web components]. 100% API access to back end. TOP% APIS for inter-module comm. Micro services for the rest.

Decoupling between the clients and the server is achieved by channeling all communication via APIs, making sure that mobile clients can be first class citizens in this brave new world.

MODULES

PERSONA Itâ€™s me, this is where the user will create her account, her bio, her CV.

MY HISTORY This is what she has done, her valuations, her HR stuff from former jobs, her portfolio.

COMPANY The hirers, if you work for a company, they have hired you, if you work for an individual, she has hired you, if you do contract job, you have been hired. No matter what you do, you are being hired by someone or some company. These are the HIRERS.

CONTRACTS Between PERSONA and COMPANY. Of every conceivable kind.
