# PERSONA-HRM (CODE NAME)
Human Resources Management for the 21st Century

I need to write a better README. This one is just the result of trying to translate into English a bunch of twisted lines connecting boxes that I drew on a piece of paper when I was trying to establish a starting point for this project. 

So read on at your own risk.

PERSONA has been conceived as an HRM platform that emphasizes the HUMAN part of the HRM.

Now, since github is for code, I will briefly describe a few of the design goals and technical elements that will be a part of the platform.

Some desired goals are: complete decoupling between server and clients. Webcomponents on the client side. APIs, Microservices where they make sense (and sometimes where they do not! :) ).

MODULES

PERSONA Itâ€™s me, this is where the user will create her account, her bio, her CV.

MY HISTORY This is what she has done, her valuations, her HR stuff from former jobs, her portfolio.

COMPANY The hirers, if you work for a company, they have hired you, if you work for an individual, she has hired you, if you do contract job, you have been hired. No matter what you do, you are being hired by someone or some company. These are the HIRERS.

CONTRACTS Between PERSONA and COMPANY. Of every conceivable kind.

APIs: 
   * Payroll
   * Access
   * Control
   * HR
   * Worked Hours
   * Evaluations
   * Other...
